A plugin to block all requests from Russia to any WordPress site and display a pro-Ukraine message instead ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

### What does this plugin do?

The Embargoed plugin checks the IP of visitors coming to your site for their origin. If it detects
a Russian IP, instead of continuing as normal it will block the visit and display a
pro-Ukrainian message.

The message looks as follows:
